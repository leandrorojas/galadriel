galadriel is a Test Management System


a simple, badly-designed, extremelly code-inefficient and unoptimized Test Management System, which inherits inspiration from testlink. Built with Reflex It's built to work, but feel free to turn it into a perfect community product. The only request is that you commit your changes to this repo for everyone to enjoy (?).

requirements:
* reflex 0.5.10
* reflex-local-auth 0.2.2

If you want to contribute, galadriel currently needs:
* unit tests
* code optimization/reusability
