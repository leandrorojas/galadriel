galadriel is a Test Management System


a simple, badly-designed, extremelly code-inefficient and unoptimized Test Management System, which inherits inspiration from testlink. Built with Reflex It's built to work, but feel free to turn it into a perfect community product. The only request is that you commit your changes to this repo for everyone to enjoy (?). If you want to contribute, let me know
