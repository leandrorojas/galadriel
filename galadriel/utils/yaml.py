"""YAML helper functions.

This module exposes two small helpers for reading and writing settings to a
YAML file.  The previous implementation of :func:`write_setting` assumed that
the configuration file and the desired section already existed.  When the file
or section was missing a ``KeyError`` or ``FileNotFoundError`` was raised and
silently swallowed, leaving the file untouched.  As a consequence calls such
as ``write_setting('galadriel.yaml', 'galadriel', 'first_run', 1)`` would fail
when ``galadriel.yaml`` did not yet exist â€“ exactly the situation that happens
on the first run of the application.

The function now creates the configuration file (and any missing sections)
when necessary so the setting is reliably written.
